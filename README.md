### [📜 Licensing service](https://github.com/Siiir/java-licensing-service) on Spring Boot 🍃
🔧 Allows creation, reading, update, and deactivation of licenses.  
🌱 All licenses created for customers are based on the root "buyable license" and contain additional owner-specific info.

### [💬 Chat server](https://github.com/Siiir/java-ChatServer) on Spring Boot 🍃
📡 Serves chat messages to all chat clients that request them.  
📝 Allows clients to post new messages and efficiently ping to see if a new message was posted.

### [🎨 CanvEngine](https://github.com/Siiir/CanvEngine) on Swing 🖼️
🎮 Game engine using CPU-based rendering on `JPanel`.
#### 📖 Etymology
In "Canv-Engine," the "Canv" stands for "Canvas", as `JPanel` serves the role of "Canvas" in graphics rendering.
#### 🕹️  Examples of usage
In the `examples` submodule, **you can find some games and simulations** made using this engine.

🎮 **`plain_tanks`** game is **not fully utilizing CanvEngine** as it was only partially 🔄 ported from my first (integrated) Java game engine to *CanvEngine*.  
🕒 I only found time to make *Plain Tanks* use CanvEngine's asset server instead of the old one, which lacked good support for 🔊 caching sounds.
